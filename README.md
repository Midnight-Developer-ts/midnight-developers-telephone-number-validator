# 📱 Vynxcode's Telephone Validator

## 📖 Overview
Created as part of my FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification, this project is a fully responsive telephone number validator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The objective was to build a fully responsive telepone validator with logic functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that validates phone numbers with or without area codes.

Designed under my developer alias Vynxcode, the objective of this project was to validate U.S. phone numbers with or without area codes using JavaScript logic and regular expressions. The app features a visually unique, cell phone inspired interface that allows users to enter a number, validate it instantly, and receive clear feedback.

The project demonstrates structured validation logic, interactive user controls, and a responsive, accessible layout presented in a clean and polished design.

## ✨ Features
